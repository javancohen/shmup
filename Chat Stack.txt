Hi everyone,

	I decided we should make a chat stack so that we can talk about the project without using facebook, 
	because the notifications will get old really fast.

	Stack should build up, rather than down so the most recent messages will be viewable quickly from github.

	The design note that needs mentioning is that bullets should be shot from the hip to prevent them from coliding spacially.
